For Toon additions
================

## TAGS

The following is a guideline to tagging the entry:

 - To be tagged in square brackets:

    - `<Quality>`       -&gt; The same as mentioned in GENERAL addition rules. Can have more than one in same entry.
    - `<Size>`          -&gt; The same as mentioned in GENERAL addition rules. Can have more than one in same entry.
    - `<link>`          -&gt; Preferably IMDb link, can add a shortened wikipedia link too.
    - `<Name>`          -&gt; The name of the show such as "Doctor Who".
    - `<Title>`         -&gt; The title of particular episode(can be replaced with "Episode &lt;#&gt;" if not mentioned anywhere).
    - `<Ep Num Season>` -&gt; The season and episode number. This is of the type "SXXEYY"; XX and YY are 2/3 digit numbers with padded 0.

 - To be tagged in round brackets:

    - `<Year>`          -&gt; The year of release of show in YYYY format.

## FORMAT

This category follows the basic rules fetched from TV category. Hence, all those rules are applicable here too.

## NOTES

01. Give a SPACE after each tag in the format.
02. For a new series, you MUST give a link with the first episode of every season.
03. Use hyphen (`-`) to separate `<Name>`, `<Ep Num Season>` and `<Title>`; like: *Randy Cunningham: 9th Grade Ninja - S01E08 - Attack of The Killer Potatoes*
