<a id='tv'></a>For TV additions
================

## TAGS

The following is a guideline to tagging the entry:

 - To be tagged in square brackets:

    * `<Quality>` &rArr; The same as mentioned in GENERAL addition rules. Can have more than one in same entry.
    * `<Country>` &rArr; The same as mentioned in GENERAL addition rules.
    * `<Size>` &rArr; The same as mentioned in GENERAL addition rules.
    * `<link>` &rArr; Preferably IMDb link, can add a shortened wikipedia link too.
    * `<Name>` &rArr; The name of the show such as "Doctor Who".
    * `<Title>` &rArr; The title of particular episode (can be replaced with "Episode ##" if not mentioned anywhere).
    * `<Ep Num Season>` &rArr; The season and episode number. This is of the type "SXXEYY"; XX and YY are 2/3 digit numbers with padded 0.

 - To be tagged in round brackets:

    * `<Year>` &rArr; The year of release of show in YYYY format.
    * `<OAD>`- This is the air-date in DD.MM.YY format; such as: (31.11.13) for Nov. 31, 2013

## FORMAT

### General

>     [<Quality>] [<Country>] <Name> - <Ep Num Season> - <Title> [<size>] <magnet>

The moderator making the first addition of a particular episode, expecting a better quality to be released later may include both the qualities and sizes, or it might be appended later by the moderator making the second magnet addition. The reply that is received from *[BOT]Offliner* will look like this:

> &lt;[BOT]Offliner&gt; Your message has been added to database at entry ID #00001 and magnet ID #00001

This entry number, **000001** is very important. This is used to later add magnets.

### For further magnets' addition

Any addition of a different quality of a previously added Episode MUST BE appended to the SAME id (**000001** in example). This id of the addition can be noted by any other (or the same) moderator, who can then add the magnet to the same id but different magnet for different quality. For example: `+am 000001 <magnet>`

### For Daily Shows

For other English soaps, it is better to wait and add later (after about around 3-4 episodes release). The format for such entries is a bit different and includes the air dates:

>     [<Quality>] [<Country>] <Name> (<OAD>) - <Title/Guest> [<size>] <magnet>

### For Season Pilots (First episodes)

>     [<Quality>] [<Country>] [<Genre>] <Name> (Year) - SXXE01 - <EpsiodeName> [<link>] [<size>] <magnet>

If the `<EpisodeName>` is unavailable, use **Pilot**.

### For multiple or complete seasons

>     [<Quality>] [<Country>] [<Genre>] [Complete] [<# seasons>] <Name> (Year) [<link>] [<size>] <magnet>

Here are a few examples for each of the above sub-sections:

    [PDTV] [AUS] Wonderland - S01E13 - Messages [295 MiB]
    [HDTV] [UK] Midsomer Murders - S16E04 (The Flying Club) & S16E05 (The Killings of Copenhagen) [582 + 552 MiB]
    [HDTV] The Daily Show with Jon Stewart (28.01.14) - Louis C.K [178 MiB]
    [HDTV] [UK] [Crime] [Drama] Suspects (2014) - E01 - Pilot [ http://www.channel5.com/shows/suspects ] [ http://www.imdb.com/title/tt3443936/ ] [348 MiB]
    [HDTV] [AUS] [Comedy] [Drama] [Family] [Complete] [6 Episodes] A Moody Christmas (2012) - S01E01 to S01E06 [ http://www.abc.net.au/tv/amoodychristmas/ ] [ http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2164274/ ] [1.70 GiB]

## NOTES

 * You MAY skip the `<EpsiodeName>` if it is long, or it's compilation of more than one episode.
 * Give a SPACE after each tag in the format.
 * For a new TV series, you MUST give a link (IMDb mandatory) with the first episode of every season.
 * Use [DVDRip], [Blu-Ray Rip] when you download those files.
 * Use hyphen (`-`) to separate `<Name>`, <`Ep Num Season>` and `<Title>`; like: *Sherlock - S02E02 - The Hounds of Baskerville*
