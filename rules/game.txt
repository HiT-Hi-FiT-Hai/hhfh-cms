    * `<Platform>` &rArr; One of PC, PS2, {S3, XBOX, PSP etc. This specifies the base platform for games.
    * `<OS>` &rArr; Applicable(and MANDATORY) only to "[PC]". Can be "[WIN]", "[Linux]" etc.
    * `<Filetype>` &rArr; Basic filetype for installation. Can be "ISO", "RAR", "ZIP", "EXE". Append [Folder] if it's shared with one of these filetypes
    * `<Genre>` &rArr; Gaming genres. Can be amongst RPG, MMORPG, FPS, Racing, Arcade etc. Tag each genre separately.
    * `<GroupName>` &rArr; The name of ggroup releasing the game. Most likely like "[SKIDROW]" etc.
    * `<Title>` &rArr; Game title.
    * `<link>` &rArr; Link to official website of the game(if any), otherwise, a wikipedia/IGN reviews link shortened.

 - To be tagged in round brackets:

    * `<Year>` &rArr; The year of release of game in YYYY format.

## FORMAT

The entry format for games is like this:

>     [<Platform/OS>] [<Filetype>] [<Genre>] [<GroupName>] <Title> (<Year>) [<link>] [<size>] <magnet>

For example:

    [PS2] [ISO] [Action] [Third Person] [PAL-E] Red Dead Revolver (2004) [ http://goo.gl/01NN1 ] [2.44 GiB]
    [PC] [ISO] [Telltale Games] [Adventure] [FTS] The Wolf Among Us - Episode 2: Smoke And Mirrors (2014) [ http://goo.gl/NJu4mK ] [2.20 GiB]
    [Reshare] [PC] [ISO] [FPS] [Repack] [z10yded + SmartSteamEmu] Payday 2 v1.4.2 (2013)-With Autoupdater + LAN Co-Op Fix [ http://goo.gl/loEAqw ] [ http://goo.gl/LZN2Mq ] [4.11 GiB]

## NOTES

01. If you've personally checked the game, add "(CHECKED)" tag before `<link>`.
02. If the game has no crack released for it, add `[NO crack]" tag before the `<Title>`.
03. When adding a crack, just add magnet to previous entry and ask the original person to edit it. If the release groups are not the same, only then add your crack as separate entry.
04. For the updates of a game, either tag using "[UPDATE]" or use like this: "The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Reloaded - Update 9".
