## NOTES

01. Atleast one of `<version>` and `<Year>` tag should be present. Use both if available.
02. Give a SPACE after each tag in the format.
03. Freewares & Open source apps/softwares should not be added.
04. Offical website link of the software should be used. Don't shorten this until and unless it is very long. If official
    website link is not available, use any other links such as wiki which gives good description of the software.
05. If the software is available only as large pack, add few important magnets of the app and add a tag
    before `<ToolType>` as `[<Bundle/Package>]` in square brackets
06. Extra description such as _Bonus_, _Retail_, _Multilanguage_, _ Deluxe Edition_ , _Final_ etc. should be added after `<Version>` tag.
07. If two different magnets are used for x32 bit and for x64 bit, add `(x86 & x64)` in round brackets after version tag.
