## FORMAT

### General sports addition format

>     [<Sport>] [<Quality>] [<Info>] <Name> (<OAD>) - <Title> [<size>] <magnet>

### Examples

    [Football] [FM] [2 Parts] UCL (23.11.11) - Arsenal vs Borussia Dortmund [900 MiB]
    [WWE] [720p] WWE (03.10.12) - Main Event [484 MiB]


## NOTES

01. Use quality only for HIGH DEFINTION ADDs. Just ignore it for common additons. Those videos are pretty decent
    to watch.
02. Use MOTD for Match of the Day. Other allowed abbreviations have been listed below.
03. Use "vs." for versus. NO other variants are allowed.
04. Use full name  for clubs. Unless the entry size increases 180 characters.
05. Make a new folder for every match. Place all the things like first half, second half in that folder. Give the
    magnets of both the halves in the ADD. Read "[BOT]Offliner" help for how to guide.
06. Dont add highlights of anymatch. You may share them. You may add magnets to FM.
07. Mention the Language (in the filename and in the ADD) if it is not English.
08. Only ONE ADD per match is ALLOWED. It doesn't matter if it was HD or SD or even HL. Just add subsequent
    magnets. And ask original moderator to edit the entry for you. If they deny or are not respoinding for long
	time, then contact VIPs.
09. Dont add matches from any league after a show is added which already contains its highlights. So, for
    example don't add Premier League Matches after the MOTD is added.
10. The several allowed abbreviations are listed below.
11. AVOID SPOILERS AT ALL COSTS. You would not want anyone to spoil a movie for you. So, please, don't add spoilers
    in the addition entries. Absolutely no comments on the match to be included. Such as good climax, Messi's
	hat trick, manchester city humiliated, barca on fire etc.
12. For knockout matches just add the magnets of two halves of extra time and penalties and mention the number
    of parts. DO NOT mention "penalties included" etc. for the entry. Just name the additional parts, put them in
	the same folder and increment the number of parts in the entry.
