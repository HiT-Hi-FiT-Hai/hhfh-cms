## NOTES
 
1. AT MOST 2 entries for the same movie are allowed in this category. One is for Good quality rips and another for OK quality rips. Ask the actual moderator to edit the entry for you, if you're adding another print for the same movie.
2. Give spaces after each parameter or info or tag. The genres should each be tagged separately like "[Action] [Thriller]" and NOT "[Action/Thriller]".
3. IMDb links are mandatory. Do NOT use url shortners for IMDb links. If no IMDb link can be found, search for wikipedia page, failing which you can add it without link.
4. Name your file/directory with same name as movie, such as: "The Moth Diaries (2012).avi"
5. ALWAYS use parenthesis for year.
6. Add 1 CD version only if a 2 CD version isn't available in this category.
7. Don't add HDRip ripped from WEB-DL as WEB-DL comes within hours of such HDRip.
8. Verify the the quality of the file before adding. Sometimes p2p releasers call it a webrip when it is actually a CAM etc., Try not to add something with CAM audio.
9. FOR BOLLYWOOD MOVIES ONLY: Add DVDSCR 720p only if DVDSCR is not released.Add PDVDRip only if no version of DVDSCR is available
