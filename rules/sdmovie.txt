`<Language>` and `<Audio>` tags can be skipped for **ENG** language and audio. All other cases need to be mentioned. English movies with dual-audio MUST have the `<Audio>` tag.

## NOTES

01. AT MOST 2 entries for the same movie are allowed in this category. One is for *Good quality rips* and another for *OK quality rips*. Ask the actual moderator to edit the entry for you, if you're adding another print for the same movie.
02. Give spaces after each parameter or info or tag. The genres should each be tagged separately like "[Action] [Thriller]" and NOT "[Action/Thriller]".
03. IMDb links are mandatory. Do NOT use url shortners for IMDb links. If no IMDb link can be found, search for wikipedia page, failing which you can add it without link.
04. Name your file/directory with same name as movie, such as: "The Moth Diaries (2012).avi"
05. ALWAYS use parenthesis for year.
06. Dont add CAM or SCAM version, instead add only DVDScr (2CD) and DVDScr 720p (if available) to this category. Prefer adding a 2 CD version instead of 1 CD version for DVDScr or WEBRip or DVDRip in this category.
